> We are back here again, learning a new language.


## Rusty Roguelite

This project is a combintion of two things. First, I want to spend more time
[learning](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/) the [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)
programming language. Second, I want to give another shot at making the Roguelike that has been in my
head for so long.

So this is me seeing my shadow again.

Amazingly, I found two good Roguelike engines in Rust:

* [libtcod](https://github.com/libtcod/libtcod) - [tutorial](https://tomassedovic.github.io/roguelike-tutorial/)
* [RLTK](https://github.com/amethyst/bracket-lib) - [tutorial](https://github.com/amethyst/rustrogueliketutorial)

So, in the interests of exploring Rust, and these tools, I will build a little Roguelike in both of these
libraries and see which one I like best.


## Resources


### Resources I Definitely Used

This project will start out as an exercise in learning Rust by making another Roguelite. Which is one of
my go-to projects for new languages. As such, the first resources I used were for Rust and `tcod-rs`.
