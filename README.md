## Rusty Roguelite

This project will start out as an exercise in [learning](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/) the [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) programming language, by making a basic [Roguelite
game](https://tomassedovic.github.io/roguelike-tutorial/) using the Python/Rust library [libtcod](https://github.com/libtcod/libtcod).
